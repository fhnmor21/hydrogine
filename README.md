light weight game engine - base on oxygine engine

Oxygine game engine (https://github.com/oxygine/oxygine-framework) is a very neaty project that I came to appreciate, but I had some ideas that are very different to the direction which that project has taken. I would like to improve on top of that engine and implement the design changes that I envision... Since that project is released under MIT license I have decided to use parts of it and put together my design for a lighter game engine.

Besides that, some of the code found here started in another project I was working on that is now defunct called Minimal Game Engine, which was split in 2.
